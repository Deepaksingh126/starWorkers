Hi, I'm @Deepaksingh126! 👋

Professional Dreamer & Occasional Coder

🚀 Currently on a mission to make coding fun (or at least not boring). I’m a curious mind who broke the rule of "Don’t talk to strangers on the internet," and here we are on GitHub, my playground of ideas!




About Me----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🎉 Age: Young enough to break things, old enough to try fixing them.(18);

🤖 Title: Junior Developer (also, self-appointed Chief Fun Officer).

💡 Innovation: I don’t just think outside the box – I live outside the box... mostly because I lost the box.

🌈 Superpower: Turning caffeine into code and memes into motivation.




My Skillz (with a 'Z')-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

💻 Languages: Fluent in Python, JavaScript, and Emoji. Sometimes I speak fluent HTML, but my CSS has commitment issues.

🔧 Tools:

VS Code (aka my second brain)

Git (Version control... or "Oops, let me undo that")

StackOverflow (My real-life debugger)

codepen and AI (for my lazy version)



What I Do:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🚧 Projects: Building cool stuff that sometimes works.

🌍 Changing the world: One bug fix at a time.

🧠 Learning: Constantly learning new ways to pretend I know what I'm doing.



Fun Facts:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🦄 I'm the type of developer who believes in unicorns and writes code with glitter (metaphorically, of course).

🧑‍🚀 Once tried to launch a "Hello World" into space. Still waiting for NASA to return my calls.

🏅 My greatest achievement? Writing a piece of code that worked on the first try... just kidding, that’s a myth.


Let’s Be Friends! 👾----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
